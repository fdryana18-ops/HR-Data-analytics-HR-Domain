# HR-Data-analytics-HR-Domain

This project demonstrates a comprehensive, real-world data analytics workflow focused on employee attendance and work-from-home patterns, using an actual HR dataset (with anonymized employee identities). It showcases how to transform, analyze, and visualize complex multi-sheet Excel data in Power BI to generate actionable insights that can drive business decisions. 

Key Highlights: Real-life Dataset: Utilizes genuine HR attendance data spread across multiple months and sheets, with randomized employee identifiers to maintain privacy.

Data Preparation & Transformation: Demonstrates advanced Power BI techniques including Power Query for cleaning, unpivoting multiple date columns into a single date column, handling inconsistent headers, removing errors dynamically, and creating reusable query functions to automate repeated transformations. Dynamic Parameterization: Implements parameters and functions in Power BI to enable scalable and maintainable data processing workflows, allowing easy integration of future monthly data without manual rework.

DAX Measures & Calculations: Develops custom DAX formulas and calculated columns to measure: Total working days (excluding weekends/holidays), Presence percentage (including partial day attendances), Work-from-home counts and percentages (full and half days), Sick leave counts and percentages, with ability to detect potential health-related trends.

Interactive Dashboarding: Builds an insightful Power BI dashboard visualizing key HR metrics such as attendance trends, work-from-home preferences, sick leave patterns, and employee-level details. Business Use Cases & Insights: Identifies days with high work-from-home activity to optimize office space and scheduling. Detects sick leave spikes indicating potential health outbreaks, enabling proactive workplace safety measures. Provides data-driven support for hybrid work models, capacity planning, and team event scheduling.
